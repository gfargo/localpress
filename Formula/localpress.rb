  # because it lives in a third-party tap (oven-sh/bun) that Homebrew won't
  # auto-tap. The wrapper script checks for bun and provides install instructions.

      localpress requires Bun as its runtime. If not already installed:
        brew tap oven-sh/bun && brew install bun
        # or:
        curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

      To verify:
        localpress --version
        localpress doctor

      For updates:
        brew upgrade localpress
        # or:
        localpress update
    EOS

    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/localpress --version")
